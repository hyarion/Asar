New features:
- If you're in a namespace and a label isn't found, Asar looks in the global namespace.
- If a line ends in a comma, the next line will be appended to it. This allows infinite macro
  arguments in practice, not just in theory (300 character lines gets annoying pretty quickly).
- This technically isn't a change, but Label = Address is now a well defined operation. While it
  exists in xkas6, the only ways to find it are by inspecting the output of export.label, by
  inspecting the source code, and by mistake (I've seen it done thrice, leading to odd bugs in
  most cases). The differences to normal labels are that it does not clear sublabels, they're
  always in the global namespace, and they don't use the current code pointer.
- Sublabels can now be multiple levels deep; ..Loop is a valid label name.
- + and - labels can be infinite depth. This means that "+++++" is a valid label name.
- + and - labels no longer piggyback on sublabels; you can go to them across other labels (and you
  can call a label .__br_pos1_0 if you want).
- SMC headers are now detected from the filename extension instead of the "header" directive. This
  allows applying the same patch to both headered and unheadered ROMs. The "header" directive is
  silently ignored.
- Asar attempts to guess whether the ROM is lorom or hirom, instead of always assuming hirom. If the
  patch is being applied to a nonexistent file, Asar assumes lorom unless otherwise specified.
- If not given a ROM name, Asar checks if patchname.sfc or patchname.smc exists and applies it to
  the one it finds. If it finds zero or two ROMs with that filename, it picks .sfc. xkas always uses
  .smc in this situation.
- incbin can now include parts of a file. Syntax: incbin "File name.bin":start-end, where start and
  end are hexadecimal numbers without $. Note that math is not allowed. An ending position of 0 will
  include the rest of the file.
- Asar will ask for more arguments if double-clicked, instead of closing instantly. This is much
  more user friendly.
- If you add a colon after a sublabel (for example .Loop: ), Asar will drop the colon instead of
  silently creating an inaccessible label.
- The base command now accepts base off, which makes it act like the code is at the current location
  again.
- Parentheses are allowed at all places where math is expected.
- print can now accept dec(math) and hex(math), which prints the contents in base 10 and 16 (no zero
  padding). The contents may be any piece of math, including labels.
- print can now accept freespaceuse, which counts all data handed out by freespace, freecode, and
  freedata. That's everything print bytes is used for anyways.

(Potentially) xkas incompatible bugfixes and changes:
- rep 0 will repeat the opcode following it 0 times. However, some patches abuses this for
  conditional compilation and expects rep 0 to mean rep 1. Asar will print warnings for this, so use
  the if command instead.
- rep num : %macro() will repeat the macro num times, instead of capping it at 1. Same goes for
  incsrc. This may break conditional compilation. (rep 2 : rep 3 : NOP won't work as expected.)
- Asar will optimize label access from 24bit addressing to 16bit if possible (xkas doesn't try at
  all without assume, raw addresses or .w). This may break stuff that doesn't use PHB : PHK : PLB :
  a : PLB but still tries to read from tables.
- warnpc has been changed. In xkas, org $00F606 : warnpc $00F606 fails; however, I belive this makes
  no sense. Therefore, I have made Asar accept this code. org $00F607 : warnpc $00F606 will
  obviously still fail. The argument is meant to be the first byte you want protected.
- incbin and incsrc will look in the folder the current file is in (if you're in a macro, it's
  relative to the macro, not the caller), not in the current working directory (which is usually
  where the base patch is). This may break dynamic sprites.
- Calling defines like functions (!a()) no longer works. It's an ugly feature that breaks my macro
  abuse.
- # is no longer valid in arbitrary locations in a math string. Beside the normal use (telling that
  an opcode should use a constant, not a ROM address), it's only allowed at the start of an entry to
  db/dw/dl/dd.
- JSR.l and JMP.l are rejected. JSR.l support makes it totally impossible to figure out if RTS or
  RTL should be used, and I don't belive JMP.l makes much sense either.
- Asar does not support these opcodes: DEA (synonym of DEC A), INA (synonym of INC A), TAD (TCD),
  TDA (TDC), TAS (TCS), TSA (TSC) and SWA (XBA).
- Various operations that give undesirable behaviour in all circumstances (for example inaccessible
  labels) will print errors in Asar. (Obviously some crashes have been removed as well, but that
  won't break old xkas code.)
- { and } are no longer treated like whitespace. They can be used alone as commands (they do
  nothing), but they can't be used in the middle of opcodes. This means that NOP : { : RTS will
  work, but LDA {$19} won't. They don't need to be matched.
- Asar prefers uppercase hex over lowercase in print pc. This may confuse crappy tools, but I don't
  think any tools we use around here act like that.
- Main() is not a valid label definition (xkas treats it like Main: ).
- Asar initializes tables to garbage if you use table, while xkas initializes it to all 00.
- Asar prints errors and warnings to stderr instead of stdout. However, to keep compatibility with
  old tools, Asar will send the errors to stdout if it's renamed to xkas.exe.

New commands:
- freespace/freecode/freedata: Automatic freespace finders, including automatic RATS tags. freespace
  is expected to be followed by a comma separated list of details on which kind of freespace is
  required. Valid details are ram, noram and static; ram tells that the RAM mirrors must exist
  (which means the data must be in banks 10-3F), while noram tells that the RAM mirrors aren't
  needed (which makes Asar favor banks 40-6F and F0-FF, but it'll put it the patch the earlier banks
  if all freespace in the favored banks gets used up); it's invalid to not specify whether the RAM
  mirrors are needed. The static detail tells that the freespace may not move, once assigned; any
  attempt to make it grow will result in an error being thrown. freecode is a shortcut to freespace
  ram, and freedata is a shortcut to freespace noram.
- autoclean: This one will remove a freespace block in an existing ROM. It must not be placed in
  freespace, and it must be followed by JML, JSL or dl (for example "autoclean JSL Mymain"). This is
  so the same patch can be applied to the same ROM twice without freespace leaks. If there's no
  JSL/etc there (for example A9 02 85 19), or if it's not in the expanded area (for example 22 06 F6
  00), it will not clear anything (in case the patch wasn't applied earlier); for this reason, it's
  recommended to put a JSL or JML there. The command after it will be assembled. To remove a code
  added by an older version of your patch, you'll need a slightly more complicated code: org $00F606
  : autoclean JSL cleanstuff : cleanstuff: org $00F606 : LDA #$90 : STA $7D. If you want to remove
  some data only pointed to indirectly, you may use autoclean $108000 (math allowed), where the
  argument evaluates to any place in the RATS tag or the RATS protected data. It is safe to place
  autoclean on multiple JSLs or JMLs to the same freespace. Note that you may not aim for a label at
  the end of a freespace block; that would make Asar remove wrong freespace.
- prot: If used directly after a freecode or freedata command (that is, at the start of the RATS
  tag), it may contain a list of comma separated labels (the limit is around 80). If the freespace
  area with the prot tag is removed by an autoclean, the freespace area pointed to by the prot will
  also be reclaimed. This is intended for large data blocks that are only pointed to from inside a
  freecode statement and therefore can't be autocleaned directly. Note that your main code will need
  an autoclean, or everything will be leaked; Asar can't solve circular dependencies.
- pushpc/pullpc: In case you want to put code at one place instead of two.
- fastrom: Forces all code to be in FastROM area, even if you forget a |$800000. Only affects
  labels, so LDA $7E0019 will still work as intended.
- function: Defines a function. For details, see below.
- if/elseif/else/endif: For conditional compilation. See section "Conditionals" below for details.
- assert: Accepts an if-like condition; if the condition is false, it prints an error message.
- arch: Assembles for another architecture. Valid values are the following:
   65816 - default, the one you want in most circumstances
   spc700-raw - SPC700 code. Acts as you'd expect; org $0010 stores to PC 0x0010 in the "ROM". Don't
    mix it with 65816 code, it won't make sense.
   spc700-inline - Also SPC700 code. However, org is weirder here: It doesn't edit where it'll store
    the data; instead, it implements the standard upload system (16bit length, then location). It
    also adds a terminator at the end. If you're uploading an SPC engine, you can set the entry
    point with "startpos $1234". The location in the ROM is where the surrounding 65816 code tells
    it to be.
   superfx - Guess three times.
  Label/macro/etc syntax is the same across architectures; however, mixing labels created in
   different architectures will give odd results, and macro mixing makes little sense.
- math: Changes how the math parser works. It takes two arguments: First, it wants a setting name
  (valid settings are "pri" and "round"), then it wants "on" or "off" depending on whether you want
  it on or off. pri tells it to apply prioritization rules (exponentiation comes before
  multiplication/division, which comes before addition/subtraction, and so on). round tells whether
  Asar should round the intermidate values down to the closest integer after each operation, like
  xkas does. Because some Asar users are used to the (rather strange) behaviour of xkas,
  prioritizing is left-to-right by default, and rounding is on. Parentheses are allowed no matter
  what these settings are.
- warn: Controls a few warning-related settings. Its syntax is similar to math, but the only valid
  flag is "xkas" (warns about a few things that Asar does differently from xkas). Note that this is
  a very noisy flag and may throw lots of false positives around labels.
- bank: Makes the label optimizer act like you're in another bank. This is not the same as base;
  bank $FF : LDA Label,x : Label: db $01,$02,$03,$04 will use 24-bit addressing for the LDA
  (assuming the current base address isn't in bank $FF). org, base, freecode, freedata, and bank off
  will make it act like it's back in the current (base) bank. The purpose of this command is long
  codes that assume the data bank register is not the same as the code bank register. Note that you
  can't point it to freespaced areas. (Yes, this is the same as xkas' assume db, but that command
  has a very weird syntax, and since no other part of assume is planned for Asar, I prefer syntax
  that makes sense over backwards compatibility with a grand total of zero patches.)
- norom: Like hirom and lorom, this one determines which SNES address corresponds to which PC
  address. In norom, the SNES address is equal to the PC address. It's highly recommended to use the
  base command and a macro implementing a mapper with this one.
- sa1rom: Implements the SA-1 mapper. To tell which banks are mapped in, use sa1rom 0,1,4,6 (maximum
  is 7); the default is 0,1,2,3.
- sfxrom: Tells Asar to use the SuperFX mapper.
- @asar: Demands a minimum version of Asar for assembling the patch. Since Asar is constantly
  evolving, this is a way to tell the user why the patch breaks.
- @include, @includefrom: Tells that an asm file may not be assembled directly, but must be included
  from another file. @includefrom tells which file it's supposed to be included from, though it
  doesn't verify that it really is included from this file. It's just a sanity check.

Conditionals:
Conditionals allow a piece of code to only be assembled under certain circumstances. The syntax of a
  condition is either "42" (evaluates to true if the value is 1 or higher), "42 > 24" (the middle
  argument can be any of <, >, <=, >=, !=, = and ==), or any number of the before with " && " or
  " || " in between (you can only use one of those two in the same condition). Evaluation is lazy;
  "0 && ###" and "1 || ###" will not throw errors.
The commands that accept conditionals are if, elseif, else, and endif (and assert, but that one
  doesn't skip any code). The behaviour should be obvious.
It's nonsense to not use either readN or a couple of user-changeable defines in a condition, though
  Asar won't notice.

Functions:
Functions are what they sound like: They take zero or more arguments, and return another value. They
  can be used anywhere where other math is allowed, and they're defined with the keyword function.
Example:
function f(x) = x*x
db f(9);same as db 81 (db $51 in hex)
The = is needed. I find it to look much nicer than without it.
There are also a few predefined functions:
read1, read2, read3, read4 - Reads a few bytes from the ROM at the indicated SNES location. They
  read one, two, three, or four bytes, respectively. They're mainly intended to allow hijacking a
  patch that moves around (read3 is best suited for this), or verifying that a needed patch is
  installed (assert and read1 is probably the best combination for this, though if may also be
  useful). If you give it a second argument, it'll return that instead of throwing an error if the
  address is invalid.
canread1 through 4, canread - Returns 1 if read1 through 4 from the specified address will succeed;
  canread takes a second argument telling how many bytes you need to read.
sqrt, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, log, log10, log2 - Some random
  functions. I'm pretty sure they're totally useless in an assembler, but I felt that just four
  functions is a bit too little.
All built-in functions can be overridden by user-defined functions if you want. Prepending an
  underscore (for example _read3()) leads to the same function; this is so you can override read3
  with a function that calls _read3.

Known bugs:
- JML.w and JSL.w aren't rejected; they're treated as JML.l and JSL.l. This is since Asar has a much
  more powerful size finding system than xkas, and automatically picks .w if it contains a label in
  the same bank - even for .l-only instructions like JML. Therefore, I'm forced to either reject JML
  and JSL to a label in the same bank, or allow JML.w, and I prefer allowing unusual but bad stuff
  over rejecting common and valid stuff. Workaround: Don't do this.
- If two freespaced codes are put in the same bank, Asar will use 24bit addressing for access
  between them, even though 16bit is possible. Workaround: Merge the freespaces (use pushpc and
  pullpc if needed), or ignore it. Do not demand explicit .w addressing, since you have no guarantee
  that they'll be put in the same bank for everyone, even if they do for you.
- You can't have more than 125 freespaced areas in the same patch, due to internal limitations in
  how labels work. Workaround: Guess three times.
- If Asar wants to put two freespaced areas beside each other, a few bytes will be wasted between
  them. This is due to how the size definer works (it assumes .l addressing for everything on the
  first pass), and I can't fix it without using four passes, and I don't believe that's worth it.
  Workaround: You don't really need to care about it, it's less than 1% of the code size in all
  serious situations, and if you only use one freespace, there is no spill. If you're sure you want
  to care, merge the freespaces or make them so big they won't fit in the same bank.
- Due to how my define parser works, Label: !Define = Value will create error messages. Workaround:
  Label: : !Define = Value. However, Label: Anotherlabel = Value will work.
- rep 2 : rep 3 : NOP won't give six NOPs, it will give three. Workaround: Multiply them with each
  other, if you need to do that at all. (This bug also exists in xkas.)
- else is treated as elseif 1 in all contexts, so attaching two else commmands to the same if
  clause, or putting an elseif after an else, is not rejected (though it is rather nonsensical).

Removed commands:
- loadpc and savepc have been removed. I have never seen them used for anything legitime, and
  they're often misunderstood.
- export doesn't exist either. It's never used for anything.
- assume has been removed. It's supposed to do three things: Optimize LDA.w->LDA.b if it's in the
  direct page (not implemented in xkas, everyone uses $19 directly), optimize LDA.l->LDA.w if bank
  byte is given (can be prone to errors, Asar has a better algorithm for this), and automatically
  set AXY sizes (everyone uses .b/.w and #$10/#$0010 for this). Therefore, I consider it useless.
- print opcodes has been removed. It's never used for anything serious. However, I kept print bytes,
  print pc, and print "text".
